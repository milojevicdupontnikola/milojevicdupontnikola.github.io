# About

Hi, I am Nikola Milojevic-Dupont (he/they). 

I am a **freelancer** based in Berlin, Germany. I am available for industry and research jobs that focus on deploying (geospatial) data science to tackle sustainability, urban governance, and other societal issues. My services include consulting, data analysis or software development.

My research so far has broadly investigated the pathway from research to deployment of AI systems for climate action in cities, focusing on narratives, data needs, tool development, and practical deployment considerations. I have particular expertise in geospatial data science, gained for example from leading the development of <a href="eubucco.com">EUBUCCO</a>), a curated dataset of more than 200 million building footprints in Europe.

I hold a PhD from the Technical University Berlin and wrote my doctoral <a href="https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/da94c4cc-c088-4b8d-836e-5cfc37d2c149">dissertation</a> on “Geospatial artificial intelligence for scaling low-carbon planning” under the supervision of Felix Creutzig. I worked for 7 years in Felix Creutzig's <a href="https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/climate-economics-and-policy/research/cities-data-science-and-sustainable-planning">lab</a> at MCC Berlin, now part of the renowned Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research (PIK). 

I am also a founding member of Climate Change AI (<a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">CCAI</a>), a global non-profit aiming to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning, where I have taken on various roles including chairing the organization’s educational content committee and being a member its board of directors.
